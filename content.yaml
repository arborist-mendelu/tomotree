      - Open source software for **acoustic tomography** of trees.
      - Also allows processing of *resistograph* data.
      - Combination of tomograph and resistograph data.
      - Easy to use graphical user interface based on Streamlit.
      - Available as Python package or Docker container.

      - TomoTree simplifies visualization of acoustic rays in the tree cross-section.
      - Put rays and cross section photo (if available) together.
      - Speed filter for rays allows to focus on the slowest or the fastest rays.
      - Helps to identify problematic rays and improve tomogram quality.

      - Several reconstruction methods available.
      - No black box. Each reconstruction method well documented.
      - The tomogram can be compared with the photo of the actual cross section, if available.
      - Colormap for speed visualization can be adjusted.

      - The stable GUI interface contains well tested code which allows to utilize TomoTree without programming skills.
      - The development version of the GUI interface contains new features which will be propagated to the stable branch after testing period.
      - You can also run TomoTree locally using Docker or Conda. See the [documentation](https://robert-marik.github.io/tomotree/doc.html#installation) on GitHub.
